This page contains a featured image (which can be seen above) as well as an image within the body of the article (like the one below):

![Hello world](./post-it.jpg)

One thing to keep in mind for the feature image is that it can use an image within the same folder as the source markdown file as well as a relative path of a folder with images. In that last case, it is important that the images within that folder are being processed.

Pretty cool!
